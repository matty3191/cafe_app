New to version 4:

- converted lists into dictionaries i.e. {"name" : "coke zero", "price" : 0.8}, {"name" : "Patrick", "phone" : "0798776887"}
- added courier and items to the order dict
- converted .txt into .csv files
- restructured directory and modules
    - set up new files and folderswhich will:
        - eventually house the abstracted functions / classes
        - have a separate unit testing file
- implemented OOP to abstract functions away from the actual application
- created this READ-ME file
- written unit tests
- broken down functions

- project background
- client requirements


Overview
Your client has launched a pop-up café in a busy business district. They
are offering home-made lunches and refreshments to the surrounding
offices. As such, they require a software application which helps them to
log and track orders.

Week 4 Brief:

Now that we’ve learned how to work with two-dimensional data, let’s refactor
our app to use dictionaries for both product and courier.
Building upon our use of a courier index within our order, let’s create a list of
product indexes now for order items.
We’ll also need to refactor our storage layer to use .csv files rather than .txt
to bring back our persistence functionality.
To show that our code works, we will also need to write unit tests to prove that
our app works correctly

Goals
As a user I want to:
• create a product, courier, or order dictionary and add it to a list
• view all products, couriers, or orders
• update the status of an order
• persist my data
• STRETCH update or delete a product, order, or courier
• BONUS list orders by status or courier
